Database setup¶
Now, open up mysite/settings.py. It’s a normal Python module with module-level variables representing Django settings.

By default, the configuration uses SQLite. If you’re new to databases, or you’re just interested in trying Django, this is the easiest choice. SQLite is included in Python, so you won’t need to install anything else to support your database. When starting your first real project, however, you may want to use a more scalable database like PostgreSQL, to avoid database-switching headaches down the road.

If you wish to use another database, install the appropriate database bindings and change the following keys in the DATABASES 'default' item to match your database connection settings:

ENGINE – Either 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 'django.db.backends.mysql', or 'django.db.backends.oracle'. Other backends are also available.
NAME – The name of your database. If you’re using SQLite, the database will be a file on your computer; in that case, NAME should be the full absolute path, including filename, of that file. The default value, BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3', will store the file in your project directory.
If you are not using SQLite as your database, additional settings such as USER, PASSWORD, and HOST must be added. For more details, see the reference documentation for DATABASES.While you’re editing mysite/settings.py, set TIME_ZONE to your time zone.

Also, note the INSTALLED_APPS setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects.

By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:

django.contrib.admin –
django.contrib.auth – 
django.contrib.contenttypes – 
django.contrib.sessions –
django.contrib.staticfiles 
These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.

Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:

lt tags, you only need to provide tags for the levels you wish to override:

from django.contrib.messages import constants as messages

MESSAGE_TAGS = {
    messages.INFO: "",
    50: "critical",
}
Using messages in views and templates¶
add_message(request, level, message, extra_tags='', fail_silently=False)[source]¶
Adding a message¶
To add a message, call:

from django.contrib import messages

messages.add_message(request, messages.INFO, "Hello world.")
Some shortcut methods provide a standard way to add messages with commonly used tags (which are usually represented as HTML classes for the message):

messages.debug(request, "%s SQL statements were executed." % count)
messages.info(request, "Three credits remain in your account.")
messages.success(request, "Profile details updated.")
messages.warning(request, "Your account expires in three days.")
messages.error(request, "Document deleted.")

Displaying messages¶
get_messages(request)[source]¶
In your template, use something like:

{% if messages %}
<ul class="messages">
    {% for message in messages %}
    <li{% if message.tags %} class="{{ message.tags }}"{% endif %}>{{ message }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}


If you’re using the context processor, your template should be rendered with a RequestContext. Otherwise, ensure messages is available to the template context.

Even if you know there is only one message, you should still iterate over the messages sequence, because otherwise the message storage will not be cleared for the next request.

The context processor also provides a DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LEVELS variable which is a mapping of the message level names to their numeric value:

{% if messages %}
<ul class="messages">
    {% for message in messages %}
    <li{% if message.tags %} class="{{ message.tags }}"{% endif %}>
        {% if message.level == DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LEVELS.ERROR %}Important: {% endif %}
        {{ message }}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
Outside of templates, you can use get_messages():

from django.contrib.messages import get_messages

storage = get_messages(request)
for message in storage:
    do_something_with_the_message(message)
For instance, you can fetch all the messages to return them in a JSONResponseMixin instead of a TemplateResponseMixin.

get_messages() will return an instance of the configured storage backend.

Creating custom message levels¶
Messages levels are nothing more than integers, so you can define your own level constants and use them to create more customized user feedback, e.g.:

CRITICAL = 50


def my_view(request):
    messages.add_message(request, CRITICAL, "A serious error occurred.")
When creating custom message levels you should be careful to avoid overloading existing levels. The values for the built-in levels are:

Level Constant	Value
DEBUG	10
INFO	20
SUCCESS	25
WARNING	30
ERROR	40
If you need to identify the custom levels in your HTML or CSS, you need to provide a mapping via the MESSAGE_TAGS setting.

Note

If you are creating a reusable application, it is recommended to use only the built-in message levels and not rely on any custom levels.

Changing the minimum recorded level per-request¶
The minimum recorded level can be set per request via the set_level method:


from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from myapp.models import Author

# Change the messages level to ensure the debug message is added.
messages.set_level(request, messages.DEBUG)
messages.debug(request, "Test message...")

# In another request, record only messages with a level of WARNING and higher
messages.set_level(request, messages.WARNING)
messages.success(request, "Your profile was updated.")  # ignored
messages.warning(request, "Your account is about to expire.")  # recorded

# Set the messages level back to default.
messages.set_level(request, None)
Similarly, the current effective level can be retrieved with get_level:

from django.contrib import messages

current_level = messages.get_level(request)
For more information on how the minimum recorded level functions, see Message levels above.

Adding extra message tags¶
For more direct control over message tags, you can optionally provide a string containing extra tags to any of the add methods:

messages.add_message(request, messages.INFO, "Over 9000!", extra_tags="dragonball")
messages.error(request, "Email box full", extra_tags="email")
Extra tags are added before the default tag for that level and are space separated.

Failing silently when the message framework is disabled¶
If you’re writing a reusable app (or other piece of code) and want to include messaging functionality, but don’t want to require your users to enable it if they don’t want to, you may pass an additional keyword argument fail_silently=True to any of the add_message family of methods. For example:

messages.add_message(
    request,
    messages.SUCCESS,
    "Profile details updated.",
    fail_silently=True,
)
messages.info(request, "Hello world.", fail_silently=True)
Note

Setting fail_silently=True only hides the MessageFailure that would otherwise occur when the messages framework disabled and one attempts to use one of the add_message family of methods. It does not hide failures that may occur for other reasons.

Adding messages in class-based views¶
class views.SuccessMessageMixin¶
Adds a success message attribute to FormView based classes

get_success_message(cleaned_data)¶
cleaned_data is the cleaned data from the form which is used for string formatting

Example views.py:

from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from myapp.models import Author


class AuthorCreateView(SuccessMessageMixin, CreateView):
    model = Author
    success_url = "/success/"
    success_message = "%(name)s was created successfully"
The cleaned data from the form is available for string interpolation using the %(field_name)s syntax. For ModelForms, if you need access to fields from the saved object override the get_success_message() method.

Example views.py for ModelForms:

from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from myapp.models import ComplicatedModel


class ComplicatedCreateView(SuccessMessageMixin, CreateView):
    model = ComplicatedModel
    success_url = "/success/"
    success_message = "%(calculated_field)s was created successfully"

    def get_success_message(self, cleaned_data):
        return self.success_message % dict(
            cleaned_data,
            calculated_field=self.object.calculated_field,
        )
Expiration of messages¶
The messages are marked to be cleared when the storage instance is iterated (and cleared when the response is processed).

To avoid the messages being cleared, you can set the messages storage to False after iterating:

storage = messages.get_messages(request)
for message in storage:
    do_something_with(message)
storage.used = False
Behavior of parallel requests¶
Due to the way cookies (and hence sessions) work, the behavior of any backends that make use of cookies or sessions is undefined when the same client makes multiple requests that set or get messages in parallel. For example, if a client initiates a request that creates a message in one window (or tab) and then another that fetches any uniterated messages in another window, before the first window redirects, the message may appear in the second window instead of the first window where it may be expected.

In short, when multiple simultaneous requests from the same client are involved, messages are not guaranteed to be delivered to the same window that created them nor, in some cases, at all. Note that this is typically not a problem in most applications and will become a non-issue in HTML5, where each window/tab will have its own browsing context.

Settings¶
A few settings give you control over message behavior:

MESSAGE_LEVEL
MESSAGE_STORAGE
MESSAGE_TAGS
For backends that use cookies, the settings for the cookie are taken from the session cookie settings:

SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY
